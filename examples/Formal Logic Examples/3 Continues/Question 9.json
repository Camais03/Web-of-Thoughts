To test this option, we'll examine the premises step by step:  From premise 2, \"G ⊃ F,\" we can apply the rule of contraposition and derive ~F ⊃ ~G.  We also have premise 5, \"~I.\"  By applying the rule of disjunctive syllogism to premise 3 and premise 5, we can deduce H (discharging ~E as a possibility).  Lastly, combining premise 4, \"H ⊃ I,\" and premise 5, \"~I,\" through modus tollens, we obtain ~H.  Considering these deductions, the only valid immediate consequence is option D) \"~H.\" ","Type":"Thought","Critique":"The researcher correctly analyzes option B) \"F ⊃ G\" and applies the rule of contraposition to derive ~F ⊃ ~G from premise 2. However, the researcher makes an error in their deduction when they combine premise 4, \"H ⊃ I,\" and premise 5, \"~I,\" through modus tollens to obtain ~H. This deduction is incorrect. Modus tollens can only be applied to statements in the form \"If P, then Q\" and \"~Q,\" but the researcher tries to apply it to \"H ⊃ I\" and \"~I,\" which is not a valid use of the rule.
