It correctly states that there exist houses that are bigger than some large apartments, which aligns with the (∃y)(Hy • Bxy) part of the proposition.  Based on this analysis, options A and D are potential correct interpretations of the given proposition. But to select the best one, we need to consider the complete proposition.
